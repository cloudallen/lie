\section{Weyl Group}
The structure of root system is very deeply connected to that of reflection groups, and within any root system, there's a clear reflection group: The group generated by all root reflections
\begin{defi}
	The group generated by all of the root reflections is called the Weyl group:
	$$ \W = \langle s_\alpha | \alpha \in \Phi\rangle $$
	\label{Wdef}
\end{defi}
It is clear that this group is finite as a subgroup of root permutations, since reflections preserve the inner product, so does $\W$, and therefore $\W$ can be viewed as a finite subgroup of orthogonal transformations of $E$.\\
Another important point to consider is that $\W$ is normal in the group of automorphisms of $\Phi$, let $\Aut \Phi = \{T \in \gl(V)| T(\Phi)=\Phi \text{ and } \cartan{\alpha}{\beta} = \cartan{T(\alpha)}{T(\beta)}\}$
\begin{prop}
	If $T \in \Aut \Phi$ then $Ts_\alpha T^{-1} = s_{T(\alpha)}$
	\label{Wnormality}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\beta \in \Phi$ be any root, then:
	$$Ts_\alpha T^{-1}(\beta) = Ts_\alpha(T^{-1}\beta) = T(T^{-1}\beta - \cartan{T^{-1}\beta,\alpha}\alpha) = \beta - \cartan{\beta}{T(\alpha)}T(\alpha) = s_{T(\alpha)}(\beta)$$
	Since $\Phi$ spans $E$, the result follows.
\end{proof}
\begin{lema}
	Let $\alpha_1,\cdots,\alpha_n \in\Delta$ (not necessarily distinct). Write $s_{\alpha_i}=s_i$. If $s_1\cdots s_{n-1}(s_n)$ is a negative root, then there exists some $1\le t<n$ such that $s_1 \cdots s_n = s_1 \cdots s_{t-1}s_{t+1} \cdots s_{n-1}$
\end{lema}
\begin{proof}
	Write $\beta_i = s_{i+1} \cdots s_{n-1}(\alpha_n)$ for $1\le i \le n-2$ and $\beta_{n-1} = \alpha_n$. Since $\beta_0$ is negative by hypothesis and $\beta_{n-1}$ is positive, we can find the smallest index $t$ such that $\beta_t$ is positive.\\
	But then $\sigma_t{\beta_t} = \beta_{t-1}$ which is negative, this forces $\beta_t = \alpha_t$ by Lemma \ref{permutepositive}, considering Proposition $\ref{Wnormality}$ for $T \in \W$ we have that:
	$$s_{T(\alpha)} = Ts_\alpha T^{-1}$$ 
	In particular since $\alpha_t = s_{t+1}\cdots s_{n-1}(\alpha_n)$
	$$s_t =  (s_{t+1}\cdots s_{n-1}) s_n (s_{n-1}\cdots s_{t+1})$$
\end{proof}
\begin{corol}
	If $s \in \W$ is written as a multiplication of simple roots $s=s_1\cdots s_t$, with $t$ as small as possible, then $s(\alpha_t)$ is negative.
	\label{Wcorolsimple}
\end{corol}
We want to prove that $\W$ is generated by a basis $\Delta(\gamma)$, for this consider the subgroup $\W'(\gamma)$ as $\langle s_\alpha | \alpha \in \Delta(\gamma)\rangle$, then the following is valid for $\W'(\gamma)$:
\begin{teo}
	If $\gamma' \in R$ is another regular element, then there exists $s \in \W'$ such that $\langle s(\gamma'),\alpha \rangle >0$ for all $\alpha \in \Delta$, and in particular there exists $s' \in \W'(\gamma)$ such that $s'(\Delta(\gamma)) = \Delta(\gamma')$ 
	\label{32conjugacychambers}
\end{teo}
\begin{proof}
	Consider $\delta$ as defined in Corollary \ref{corolexistancedelta} and choose $s \in \W'$ such that $\langle s(\gamma'),\delta\rangle $ is as big as possible.\\
	For any $\alpha \in \Delta(\gamma)$, then $ss_\alpha \in \W'$, and the choice of $s$ implies:
	\begin{align*}
		\langle s(\gamma'),\delta\rangle \ge \langle s_\alpha s(\gamma'),\delta\rangle  &= \langle s(\gamma'),s_\alpha(\delta)\rangle \\
		&= \langle s(\gamma'), \delta - \alpha \rangle \\
		&= \langle s(\gamma'),\delta \rangle - \langle s(\gamma'),\alpha\rangle 
	\end{align*}
	Which implies that $\langle s(\gamma'), \alpha \rangle \ge 0$, but it can't be $0$, since $\langle s(\gamma'),\alpha \rangle = \langle \gamma', s^{-1}(\alpha)\rangle$ and $\gamma'$ is regular.\\
	Now let $s'=s^{-1}$, we want to prove that $s'(\Delta(\gamma))$ is irreducible with respect to $\Phi^+(\gamma')$. Since $\langle \gamma', s'(\alpha) > 0$ for any $\alpha \in \Delta$, the same is true for $\Phi^+(\gamma)$ since they are in the $\mathbb{Z}_+$ of $\Delta(\gamma)$, therefore proving, since they have the same cardinality that $\Phi^+{\gamma'} = s'(\Phi^+(\gamma))$\\
	Now suppose that $s'(\Delta(\gamma))$ is not composed of irreducible roots with respect to $\gamma'$, then there exists an $\alpha \in \Delta(\gamma)$  and $\beta_1,\beta_2 \in \Phi_+{\gamma} $ such that $s'(\alpha) = s'(\beta_1 + \beta_2)$, but this in turn implies that $\alpha = \beta_1 + \beta_2$, contradicting the fact that $\alpha$ is an irreducible root.\\
\end{proof}
\begin{lema}
	Given any root $\alpha$, then there exists a regular element $\gamma$ such that $\alpha \in \Delta(\gamma)$.
	\label{32anyrootisbasic}
\end{lema}
\begin{corol}
	Given any root $\alpha$, then there exists $s \in \W'(\gamma)$ such that $s(\alpha) \in \Delta(\gamma)$
	\label{32conjugacyofroots}
\end{corol}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\gamma' \in R$ be such that $\alpha \in \Delta(\gamma')$ (Lemma \ref{32anyrootisbasic}) and let $s \in \W'$ be such that $s(\Delta(\gamma'))=\Delta(\gamma)$(Theorem \ref{32conjugacychambers}), then $s(\alpha) \in \Delta(\gamma)$
\end{proof} 
\begin{prop}
	$\W = \W'(\gamma)$ for any $\gamma \in R$Â´
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	We'll prove that $s_\alpha$ for $\alpha \in \Phi$ is an element of $\W'(\gamma)$, using Corollary \ref{32conjugacyofroots} then there exists $s \in \W'$ such that $s(\alpha) \in \Delta(\gamma)$, call $s(\alpha)=\beta$, then $s^{-1}(\beta)=\alpha$, but on the other hand(Proposition \ref{Wnormality}):
	$$s_\alpha = s_{s^{-1}\beta} = s^{-1}s_\beta s \in \W' $$
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}
	The only $s \in \W$ such that $s(\Delta)=\Delta$ in $\W$ is $1$
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $s(\Delta)=\Delta$ but $s \not= 1$, then Corollary \ref{Wcorolsimple} implies that $s(\alpha_k)$ is negative for some $k$, a contradiction.
	
\end{proof}
